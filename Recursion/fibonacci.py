# Given a number N return the index value of the Fibonacci sequence, where the sequence is:

# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ...
# the pattern of the sequence is that each value is the sum of the 2 previous values, that means that for N=5 â†’ 2+3

# For example: fibonacciRecursive(6) should return 8
